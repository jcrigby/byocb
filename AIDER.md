# AI Chat PWA - Aider Development Guide

This file provides prompts and guidance for enhancing the AI Chat PWA using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) - an AI pair programming tool.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-pwa-repo
cd your-pwa-repo

# Start Aider with your preferred model
aider --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
# or
aider --model openai/gpt-4

# Add all files to Aider's context
/add index.html manifest.json sw.js
```

```

## ðŸš¦ Development Guidelines

### Before Starting
1. Always test the current app functionality first
2. Read through the existing code to understand the architecture
3. Consider PWA requirements for any new features
4. Test on both desktop and mobile browsers

### Best Practices
- Maintain PWA compatibility with all changes
- Keep the app lightweight and fast
- Ensure offline functionality isn't broken
- Test across different screen sizes
- Validate accessibility improvements
- Update the manifest.json if adding new capabilities

### Testing New Features
```bash
# Test PWA functionality
# Serve locally to test PWA features
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .

# Test offline functionality
# Use Chrome DevTools -> Network -> Offline
```

## ðŸ“± Mobile-First Considerations

When adding features, always consider:
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Performance on slower devices
- Battery usage optimization
- Network usage minimization
- iOS Safari and Android Chrome compatibility
- App-like navigation patterns

## ðŸ”® Future Roadmap Ideas

- **Multi-user support**: Shared chats and collaboration
- **AI Agents**: Background AI assistants for specific tasks
- **Plugin system**: Extensible architecture for custom features
- **Analytics**: Usage patterns and optimization insights
- **Enterprise features**: Team management, usage controls
- **Native app**: Electron or Tauri wrapper for desktop
